## 2024-05-28 - [Sync Deduplication in Flutter build()]
**Learning:** Performing deduplication *after* an async task within a Flutter `build` method is a performance trap. If a widget rebuilds rapidly (e.g., during scrolling), the async task won't complete before the next `build` fires, bypassing the deduplication check and spawning dozens of redundant async file system checks and network requests.
**Action:** Always maintain a synchronous `Set` of started/completed tasks to check *before* initiating expensive async operations or scheduling `addPostFrameCallback` from within `build()`.
